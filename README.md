# Data-Driven Insights into Carbon Emissions Reduction
This project utilizes data analytics, statistical models, and machine learning techniques to analyze carbon emissions data and identify key areas for reduction. Using a synthetic dataset that represents carbon emissions data from multiple countries over a decade, the project explores the relationship between carbon emissions, GDP, population, and energy consumption. The goal is to provide actionable insights and strategies to reduce carbon emissions, contributing to environmental sustainability.
